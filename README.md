### About the Author    
I’m a programming novice who made a career shift from animation production to computer science.   
Eager to sharpen my algorithmic skills, I’ve embarked on this learning journey to fill the gaps in my technical foundation and grow into a more competent developer.  
    
### Repository Overview    
This repository serves as a record of my daily LeetCode practice.   
I plan to start with basic-level problems, build up my problem-solving ability step by step, and work my way toward completing 2000 core algorithm problems over time.  
    
### A Note to Fellow Developers    
My code and problem-solving approaches are far from perfect, given my limited experience.   
I sincerely welcome any feedback, suggestions, or corrections from more experienced peers.   
If you spot flaws in my logic, have more optimized solutions, or want to share your own learning insights, please feel free to reach out and guide me—I would be extremely grateful for your help!
